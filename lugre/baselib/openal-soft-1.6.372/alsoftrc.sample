# OpenAL config file. Options that are not under a block or are under the
# [general] block are for general, non-backend-specific options. Blocks may
# appear multiple times, and duplicated options will take the last value
# specified.
# The system-wide settings can be put in /etc/openal/alsoft.conf and user-
# specific override settings in ~/.alsoftrc.
# For Windows, these settings should go into %AppData%\alsoft.ini
# The environment variable ALSOFT_CONF can be used to specify another config
# override

# Option and block names are case-insenstive. The supplied values are only
# hints and may not be honored (though generally it'll try to get as close as
# possible). These are the current available settings:

format = AL_FORMAT_STEREO16  # Sets the output format. Can be one of:
                             # AL_FORMAT_MONO8    (8-bit mono)
                             # AL_FORMAT_STEREO8  (8-bit stereo)
                             # AL_FORMAT_QUAD8    (8-bit 4-channel)
                             # AL_FORMAT_51CHN8   (8-bit 5.1 output)
                             # AL_FORMAT_61CHN8   (8-bit 6.1 output)

                             # Default is AL_FORMAT_STEREO16

cf_level = 0  # Sets the crossfeed level for stereo output. Valid values are:
              # 0 - No crossfeed
              # 1 - Low crossfeed
              # 2 - Middle crossfeed
              # 3 - High crossfeed (virtual speakers are closer to itself)
              # 4 - Low easy crossfeed
              # 5 - Middle easy crossfeed
              # 6 - High easy crossfeed
              # Default is 0. Users of headphones may want to try various
              # settings. Has no effect on non-stereo modes.

frequency = 44100  # Sets the output frequency. Default is 44100

refresh = 4096  # Sets the buffer size, in frames. Default is 4096. Note that
                # the actual granularity may or may not be less than this.

sources = 256  # Sets the maximum number of allocatable sources. Lower values
               # may help for systems with apps that try to play more sounds
               # than the CPU can handle. Default is 256

stereodup =  # Sets whether to duplicate stereo sounds on the rear speakers for
             # 4+ channel output. This can make stereo sources substantially
             # louder than mono or even 4+ channel sources, but provides a
             # "fuller" playback quality. True, yes, on, and non-0 values will
             # duplicate stereo sources. 0 and anything else will cause stereo
             # sounds to only play out the front speakers.
             # Default is false

drivers =  # Sets the backend driver list order, comma-seperated. Unknown
           # backends and duplicated names are ignored, and unlisted backends
           # won't be considered for use. An empty list means the default.
           # Default is:
           # alsa,oss,solaris,dsound,winmm,wave

excludefx =  # Sets which effects to exclude, preventing apps from using them.
             # This can help for apps that try to use effects which are too CPU
             # intensive for the system to handle. Available effects are:
             # reverb
             # Default is empty (all available effects enabled)

[alsa]  # ALSA backend stuff
device = default  # Sets the device name for the default playback device.
                  # Default is default

periods = 0  # Sets the number of update buffers for playback. A value of 0
             # means auto-select. Default is 0

capture = default  # Sets the device name for the default capture device.
                   # Default is default

mmap = true  # Sets whether to try using mmap mode (helps reduce latencies and
             # CPU consumption). If mmap isn't available, it will automatically
             # fall back to non-mmap mode. True, yes, on, and non-0 values will
             # attempt to use mmap. 0 and anything else will force mmap off.
             # Default is true.

[oss]  # OSS backend stuff
device = /dev/dsp  # Sets the device name for OSS output. Default is /dev/dsp

periods = 4  # Sets the number of update buffers. Default is 4

capture = /dev/dsp  # Sets the device name for OSS capture. Default is /dev/dsp

[solaris]  # Solaris backend stuff
device = /dev/audio  # Sets the device name for Solaris output. Default is
                     # /dev/audio

[dsound]  # DirectSound backend stuff
periods = 4  # Sets the number of updates for the output buffer. Default is 4

[winmm]  # Windows Multimedia backend stuff
         # Nothing yet...

[wave]  # Wave File Writer stuff
file =  # Sets the filename of the wave file to write to. An empty name
        # prevents the backend from opening, even when explicitly requested.
        # THIS WILL OVERWRITE EXISTING FILES WITHOUT QUESTION!
        # Default is empty
